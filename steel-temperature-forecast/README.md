## Steel Temperature Forecast

### Main project task:
Build a model that predicts the temperature of the steel after its full processing cycle in order to optimize plant's production costs

### Data description:
- heating electrodes data;
- data on the supply of bulk materials (*volume*);
- data on the supply of bulk materials (*time*);
- data on alloy gas purge;
- temperature measurements results;
- data on wire materials (*volume*);
- data on wire materials (*time*).

### Project stages
- Exploratory data analysis
- Date preprocessing
- Target and feature variables determination
- Training, Validation and Test samples formation
- Models training and parameters tuning 
- Choosing the best model based on the proposed metric
- Sanity check of the model
- Feature Importance Analysis

### Libraries and methods used 
`pandas`, `seaborn`, `exploratory data analysis`, `data preprocessing`, `machine learning`, `gradient boosting`, `sklearn`, `feature engineering`
